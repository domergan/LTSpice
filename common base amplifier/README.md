The collector-base bias is achieved directly by the the battery in the voltage-divider circuit.

Since the transistor used is a PNP transistor, reverse bias is achieved by making the collector negative with respect to the base.

Forward bias in the emitter-base circuit (PNP transistor) requires that the emitter be positive with respect to the base.

This condition is achieved by the voltage-divider network consisting of resistors R2 and R3.

The voltage drop on R2 places the emitter at a positive potential with respect to the base.

If a NPN transistor were used, we would only need to swap the battery.
